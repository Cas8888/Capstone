# Capstone
For my capstone project I created a Reference Image Generator website. The purpose of this website is to randomly generate images that artists can use as reference material when drawing. 
Visual artists often experience decision fatigue when finding photos to draw and can spend more time looking for a photo than actually practicing their skills. Additionally, they must be aware of copyrighted works and avoid drawing from photos they do not have permission to use. A Reference Image Site ensures that artists have a photo selected for them to eliminate the process of searching for one as well as provides a photo they have permission to use. 

Features: 
> -This project incorporates Unsplash's free API to display random royalty-free photos in the page. 
- There is a form on the home page the user can use to search for specific subjects they would like to draw. (Currently this search function doesn't work entirely and instead will generate a random image to start with)
- The form features a validation script which will alert the user if they try to input anything that is not letters.(inputted numbers will not work/have no use for this kind of search and will generate an error).
- On the reference image page, the page will display information about the photo, specifically the photographer that originally took the photo and link to their personal portfolio site. 
- Upon visiting the reference image page, a 1 min timer will start in the top navigation bar. This feature is for artists who are using the site for quick 'warmups' where they will draw everything they can in 1 minute. 
- If the user would like a new photo or does not like the generated photo, they can click the "new photo" link to pull a new one. 
- The site is a minimal design in a dark-mode color palette to prevent eye strain and lessen distractions so the user can focus on the photo they are drawing from. 

To use this site, simply enter a subject into the form field and click "Draw!"
You will then be directed to your generated photo. 
To generate a new photo, click "new photo" in the top right corner. 
To view the photographer's portfolio for similar photos/inspiration, click the linked text near the photo.
